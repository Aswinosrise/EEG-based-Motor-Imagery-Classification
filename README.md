Description : To classify EEG motor imagery data using machine learning techniques
Start Date : 20th JANUARY 2020
End Date : 30th March 2020
DataSet : Pleae refer dataset_download pdf to get the info about dataset and download link
Code Format : MATLAB 2019b

## Initial setup
1) Extract the biosig.tar.gz package and place the resultant folder in your MATLAB workspace
2) Run the biosig_installer.m to initialise the libraries inside the package
3) Once this is done the initial setup is over


## Details about the project

1) The main aim of this research work is to understand the performance of statistical machine learning techniques like Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision trees etc.,
2) The project compares the performance of SVM kernels and different optimisation algorithms used in SVM
3) The project also experiments with different feature extraction techniques to produce best results like pca, psd, ica, csp etc.,

## Running the files

1) All files are individual scripts and can be run without any problem. The results from different files are compared which forms the crux of this research work.
